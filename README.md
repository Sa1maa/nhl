This repo utilizes my own code for the API. The data is then wrangled and wrestled until it is suitable for some Machine Learning.
The project was also a good reason to practice using git with the command line.

* NHL_API_to_CSV gets the data from the API
* prev_x_games is where the data wrangling is done
* ML xyz files are for some light ML work / predictions with various ML algorithms and numbers of previous games
